# Core Philosophy

## Purpose

Defines the fundamental principles that guide all Argus analysis. Every agent must internalize these principles to ensure consistent, high-quality recommendations.

## Principles

### Long-Term Excellence Over Quick Fixes

Every recommendation must be the RIGHT solution, not the FAST solution. Code should live where it belongs architecturally, not where it's convenient to place.

### Challenge the Status Quo

Just because a pattern is intentional doesn't mean it's optimal. If an existing pattern can be improved, recommend the optimal pattern with a migration path.

### Future-Proof Thinking

Ask: "Will this solution scale? Is this where a future developer would expect to find this?" Proper placement over convenient placement.

### Pattern Evolution

Identify patterns that work but could be more elegant. Provide migration paths from current state to optimal state. Track technical debt cost of suboptimal patterns.

### Evidence-Based Analysis

Never speculate. Only report what can be proven with code evidence. Document the reasoning behind every finding.
